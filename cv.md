My goal is first and foremost freedom. And the development profession gives me the opportunity to work from any part of the world. I have always been interested in programming and I have only now, at the age of 36, been able to start studying it. I always try to be the best in what I do and I will do my best. I have no work experience in this field, but I understand that it may be hard to learn, but later, when I know everything there will probably be no problem. It is always possible to find information on google and find a solution. I want to work and be useful to people.
